## Genome dataset w/ taxonomy

table of genomes and taxonomy used in this study [organism_taxonomy.xls](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/organism_taxonomy.xls)


## Gene Extracting

log of 16S sequences extracted from genomes is located in [gene_and_length_all.xls)](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/gene_and_length_all.xls).



log of variable regions successfully extracted using amplify_fasta.py is found in[amplified_16S_summary.xls](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/amplified_16S_summary.xls)


## intra organism variation statistics

A table with  the total 16S gene copies, sequence lengths (min, max, and average), minimum percent identity, and average percent identity per genome for the complete 16S genes [complete_variation_table.xls](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/complete_variation_table.xls)  and variable portion of the gene [amplified_variation_table.xls](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/amplified_variation_table.xls) 


## Orthofinder

A complete list of pairwise comparisons for the 16S variable region dataset [amplified_16S_comparisons.xls](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/amplified_16S_comparisons.xls)



## clustering sequences

The data sheet [all_unaligned_clustalInfo.csv](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/blob/master/Data/all_unaligned_clustalInfo.csv) containes the parsed uclust clustering data for each clustering group.


## UCLUST number, percent shared genes, and taxonomy info

Tables for each clustering group for the complete 16S, variable region of the 16S and MLSA-like dataset are available in the folder [analysis_what_matches](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/tree/master/Data/analysis_what_matches). The column headers are clustering_group, percent shared genes, genomes_compared, species, full_taxonomy.


## Tables used to generate percnet identity vs. shared gene content box plots

Tables containing individual datasets for the complete 16S gene outlining orthofinder runs matched to percent identity groups are located in [matched_complete_16S_clusters/](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/tree/master/Data/matched_complete_16S_clusters)

Tables containing individual datasets for the V4 variable portion of 16S gene outlining orthofinder runs matched to percent identity groups are located in [matched_amplified_16S_clusters/](https://github.com/Joseph7e/Marker-genes-as-predictors-of-shared-genomic-function/tree/master/Data/matched_amplified_16S_clusters)
